Hantek 6022BE Python API for Linux. This is a API for Python for the
ultra-cheap, reasonably usable (and hackable) 6022BE DSO, with a libusb implementation via libusb-1.0 for Linux.

Furthermore, there are tools for data acquisition and data analysis as well as for maintenance and calibration of the scope.

For additional (interesting) details, the inquisitive reader should take two or three hours and read
this [eevblog thread](http://www.eevblog.com/forum/testgear/hantek-6022be-20mhz-usb-dso/).
